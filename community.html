      <h4>An always expanding database of real customer solutions</h4>
      <p>You set up the categories and your users provide the questions and answers!  Your community forum is a place where customers can interact with each other, to share solutions, tips and advice.</p>
      <p>Every conversation is searchable and available to customers with a similar problem.</p>

      <h4>Offload support responsibility to your best customer advocates</h4>
      <p>Save money on support costs by sharing the burden with your strongest advocates- current customers!</p>
      <p>If there is a question which is not being answered promptly, support agents can jump in and provide an answer. In fact, they see public discussions in the same UI as private tickets.</p>

      <h4>Keep control and provide assistance when needed</h4>
      <p>Don't worry about things getting out of control, you still have complete control over the community discussions.  Delete posts or deactivate discussions which are off topic, promotional or negative.</p>
      <p>You or your customers can also convert a discussion to a private ticket with a single click.</p>
