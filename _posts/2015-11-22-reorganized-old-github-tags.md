Just wanted to give a heads up that I made a slight change to how Github tag/releases are named. When I first released Helpy, I thought I was close to a version 1.0 release so I named the tags 1.0-beta1 and so on.  However, as time has progressed, I have decided to take slightly humbler approach and renamed the first release to 0.5.0.  Since then, I have given major releases a full tenth uplevel.

I am still developing in Master, and you should treat this like an edge branch, and use the tags/releases if you want something more stable.
