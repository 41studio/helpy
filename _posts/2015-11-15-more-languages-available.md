# New Languages

Great news!  A super group of [contributors](http://support.helpy.io/knowledgebase/13-About-Helpy/docs/6-Contributors-to-Helpy) have helped to internationalize Helpy, with new support for several languages:

- Catalan
- Chinese (both simplified and traditional)
- Japanese
- Estonian

I am still hoping for some help with the "core" European languages, like Spanish, German and French. If you are using Helpy,
and end up translating it for your needs, please consider contributing your work to help other users!
